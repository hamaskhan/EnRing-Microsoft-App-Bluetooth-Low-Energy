# EnRing-Microsoft-App-Bluetooth-Low-Energy
Hi, this is my project in the wearables domain consisting of a wireless electronic ring for UI control in design applications and as an input modality for wearable computing devices. It involved designing miniaturized electronics, sensor interfacing, 3D CAD modeling/printing, and software development in Microsoft UWP Platform.
